<h2 id="objectives"><a href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h2>
<p>Students are expected to gain practical exposure to tools, processes, and principles of software engineering through hands-on projects while being able to explain empirical and theoretical evidence, technical mechanisms, and models supporting software engineering.</p>
<h2 id="topics"><a href="#topics">Topics</a></h2>
<p>Introduction, Configuration Management, Software Process and Planning (including management issues), Software Costs and Schedules, Software Specification and Requirements, Software Design, Implementation, Software Testing (methods, metrics, and tools), Verification and Validation, Maintenance, Security, and other topics.</p>
<h1 id="teaching-philosophy"><a href="#teaching-philosophy">Teaching Philosophy</a></h1>
<p>We will make use of intensive classroom activities. You will be expected to participate actively in discussions.</p>
<p>Only you can learn. As the instructors, we can only guide and assist you. Thus, all of the class activities are aimed at helping you learn. What you do with that opporunity is up to you.</p>
<h1 id="assessment"><a href="#assessment">Assessment</a></h1>
<p>Exams, 5 small homeworks, 2 large projects.</p>
<p>Students will work in groups of 4 and build products in a <em>public</em> Github repo.</p>
<h2 id="five-homeworks"><a href="#five-homeworks">Five Homeworks</a></h2>
<p>For Jan, Feb, March only.</p>
<p>Due in odd weeks: some exercise specified in the <a href="homeworks.html">homeworks</a> page.</p>
<p>Due in even weeks: a review of the work of three other groups. What problems did they encounter?</p>
<h2 id="project"><a href="#project">Project</a></h2>
<p>Deliverables due end of each month. For project definition, see <a href="project.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>All reports (Project 1b and 2) will be 10 pages+ (including references diagrams etc) presetned in pdf using the &quot;Tighter Alternate style&quot; of http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates and placed on students' www4 website.</p>
<p>All slides will be written to the students www4 web site.</p>
<p>Project 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>1a: 5 marks: 10 slides, preliminary progress report</li>
<li>1b: 15 marks: final report<br /></li>
<li>1c: 10 marks: presentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Project 2: 20 marks:checking for bad smells</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick the repos of 3 project groups from this subject.</li>
<li>Define a dozen bad smells that might infect a project, justify why each might be a problem, and how it might be fixed.</li>
<li>Write tools to look for those smells in those 3 projects</li>
<li>Report the frequency of those smells in the projects.</li>
<li>Make recommendations on how to better run those project in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attendance"><a href="#attendance">Attendance</a></h3>
<p>Attendance is extremely important for your learning experience in this class. Once you reach three unexcused absences, each additional absence will reduce your attendance grade by 10%.</p>
<h3 id="late-policy"><a href="#late-policy">Late Policy</a></h3>
<p>No late homeworks or projects will be accepted. All such homeworks and assignments are a collaborative effort with other members of your group. Thus, even if one group member has issues, the group as a whole is expected to manage those issues.</p>
<h2 id="administration"><a href="#administration">Administration</a></h2>
<h3 id="course-evaluation"><a href="#course-evaluation">Course Evaluation</a></h3>
<p>Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of class. Students will receive an email message directing them to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete evaluations. All evaluations are confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular instructors.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity"><a href="#academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</a></h3>
<p>The course will follow all NCSU <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/provost/academic_policies">academic integrity regulations</a>. All students are expected to maintain traditional standards of academic integrity by giving proper credit for all work. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued. A student shall be guilty of a violation of academic integrity if he or she represents the work of others as his or her own or aid anotherâ€™s misrepresentation. Any violation associated with a homework/lab assignment, project deliverable, examination or quiz will result in a failing grade for the course. Such violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct, which may impose penalties beyond those by the instructors.</p>
<h3 id="disabilities"><a href="#disabilities">Disabilities</a></h3>
<p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with Disability Services for Students at 1900 Student Health Center, Campus Box 7509, 919-515-7653. For more information on NC State's policy on working with students with disabilities, please see the Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Regulation(REG 02.20.01).</p>
<p>Students are responsible for reviewing the PRRs which pertain to their course rights and responsibilities. These include: http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05 (Equal Opportunity and Non-Discrimination Policy Statement), http://oied.ncsu.edu/oied/policies.php (Office for Institutional Equity and Diversity),http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01 (Code of Student Conduct), and http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03 (Grades and Grade Point Average).</p>
<h3 id="non-discrimination-policy"><a href="#non-discrimination-policy">Non-Discrimination Policy</a></h3>
<p>NC State University provides equality of opportunity in education and employment for all students and employees. Accordingly, NC State affirms its commitment to maintain a work environment for all employees and an academic environment for all students that is free from all forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Retaliation against any person who complains about discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's policies and regulations covering discrimination, harassment, and retaliation may be accessed at http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05 or http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/. Any person who feels that he or she has been the subject of prohibited discrimination, harassment, or retaliation should contact the Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) at 919-515-3148.</p>
<h3 id="other-information"><a href="#other-information">Other Information</a></h3>
<p>Non-scheduled class time for field trips or out-of-class activities are NOT required for this class. No such trips are currently planned. However, if they do happen then students are required to purchase liability insurance. For more information, see http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/insurance/</p>
