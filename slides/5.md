#Early vs Late Mocking

- Mocking early in the development stage will allow developers to work independently. Mocks will be introduced when developers develop a functionality and they mirror the expected (as well as unexpected) response.

- Mocking late in the development stage will possibly cause code refactoring and reorganization. Developers can use it to mock external services.
