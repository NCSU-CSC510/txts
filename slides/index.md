- This project is a demonstration of adoption of software components early vs late in the software lifecycle
- The base application will be a student management web application.
- The software component that will be introduced is mocking. Specifically mocking of database calls and mocking of an external service to assist velopment and testing.
# Motivation

- Changes in software during the software lifecycle are inevitable.
- Anticipated requirements lead to early technology adoption.
- However, changes may require software components to be on-boarded at a later stage in the lifecycle.
- This change affects the software design, project timelines, developer allocation and may require code reorganization.
# Application

- Student management
- Make student profile, courses, search
- Java web application â€“ Simple client-server architecture

Technologies

- Data will be stored in a SQLite database
- Some profile attributes like github repositories will be obtained from external services

# Can we measure happiness?

- And the answer is ...
- $Happiness(t)=w_0+w_1\sum_{j=1}^t\gamma^{t-j}CR_j+w_2\sum_{j=1}^t\gamma^{t-j}EV_j+w_3\sum_{j=1}^t\gamma^{t-j}RPE_j$
- Some more random equations :
- $\sum_{n=1}^nn=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
- $Life=\sum_{birth}^{death}(experience)time$
# Sample representation of comparison results

- Once we compare the two methods(Early and late adoption of mocking) on various parameters, the results can be represented as below.
