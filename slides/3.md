- Changes in software during the software lifecycle are inevitable.
- Anticipated requirements lead to early technology adoption.
- However, changes may require software components to be on-boarded at a later stage in the lifecycle.
- This change affects the software design, project timelines, developer allocation and may require code reorganization.
